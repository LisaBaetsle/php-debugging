# php-debugging

Debugging is the pinpoint to being a master in any coding language.  
Everyone gets errors, but the best programmers never let it stop them and they find a way to fix it every time!

## Motivation

In this challenge, we get 10 exercises (and a bonus one) that need some debugging.  
It's up to us to find the mistakes and fix them.

## Tech/Framework used
